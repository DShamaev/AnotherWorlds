Entry for DataArt HTML5 Game Dev Hackathon. It's a tribute game about game worlds that impressed me last year.
Game is made within 48 hours using UE4 blueprint system and main build target for packaging is HTML5.

Known issues:
- HTML5 version has problems with initial canvas size and clickable area for UI that probably will be fixed in UE 4.16
